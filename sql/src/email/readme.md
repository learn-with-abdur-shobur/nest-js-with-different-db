**Structure Overview**

1. Generate OTP: Create a secure, time-bound OTP.
2. Store OTP: Save the OTP in a collection or in-memory (like Redis) with an expiration time.
3. Send Email: Use a service like Nodemailer, SendGrid, or AWS SES to deliver the OTP.
4. Validate OTP: Verify OTP before further actions (e.g., login, registration confirmation).
